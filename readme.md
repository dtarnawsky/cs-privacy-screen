# @capacitor-community/privacy-screen

This sample Capacitor application demonstrates using the `@capacitor-community/privacy-screen` plugin to prevent screenshots on iOS and Android.

Run the application and click the `Enable` button. Try to capture a screenshot in iOS and notice that it shows a black screen instead. This feature was added to v4.1.0 of `@capacitor-community/privacy-screen`.
